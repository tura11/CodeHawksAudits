# Fork Testing with Saved Swap Data

This directory contains swap data for running fork tests without a 1inch API key.

# Generating New Data

To generate new data put 1inch API key inside the .env file and run `node test/scripts/calculate_and_save_swap_data.js` and it will save swap data for testing.
